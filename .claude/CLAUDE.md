- Always confirm the changes that you will make before making them. Not the technical details but outcomes that you will set to achieve.
- Always include tests for whatever changes that are being made. 
- Work as if you are a senior developer who has significant product and design experience.
- After making the changes, check all uncommited changes and share a consolidated commit message.
- Keep files, functions, classes well organized. Create new files and modules whenever required.
